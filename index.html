    <h1>What is Zoom to Class?</h1>
    <p>
        Zoom to class is the easiest, fastest way to get to your virtual class on time. No more digging through your
        email inbox or teacher's website to find the class Zoom link! Now, you can simply put your class links into this
        app, then it will give you a link to the right class, at the right time!
        <br>
        To get started, open the app and click on settings in the top left. Then, simply enter the names of each of your
        classes, and the corresponding Zoom or Google Meet links. Now, whenever you open the app, it will display the
        name of whichever class is happening right now. Simply click on the open button, and Zoom to Class!
