    <h1>What is Zoom to Class?</h1>
    <p>
        Zoom to class is the easiest, fastest way to get to your virtual class on time. No more digging through your
        email inbox or teacher's website to find the class Zoom link! Now, you can simply put your class links into this
        app, then it will give you a link to the right class, at the right time!
        <br>
        To get started, open the app and click on settings in the top left. Then, simply enter the names of each of your
        classes, and the corresponding Zoom or Google Meet links. Now, whenever you open the app, it will display the
        name of whichever class is happening right now. Simply click on the open button, and Zoom to Class!

    <h1>Installing on Windows</h1>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, my application is not code signed for Windows. In short, what this means is that Windows will not
        trust it and will give you a pop up saying "Windows protected your PC." You need to click "more info" then click "Run
        anyway" to install Zoom to Class. I promise that this app will not give you any malware, but in order to avoid
        this popup, I would need to personally buy a code signing certificate which costs upwards of $100 per year. If
        you want to help fund my development, then feel free to click <a
